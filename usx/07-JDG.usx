	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them? <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <verse number="6" style="v"/>But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <char style="add">their food</char> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v"/>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.) <verse number="12" style="v"/>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And it came to pass, when she came <char style="add">unto him</char>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? <verse number="15" style="v"/>And she said unto him, Give me a <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">present</char></char></note>blessing; for that thou hast <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">given me the land of the South</char></char></note>set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>And the children of the Kenite, Moses&#8217; <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">father-in-law</char></char></note>brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">devoted</char>.</char></note>utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. <verse number="18" style="v"/>Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof. <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Jehovah was with Judah; and drove out <char style="add">the inhabitants of</char> the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them. <verse number="23" style="v"/>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.) <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family. <verse number="26" style="v"/>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v"/>And Manasseh did not drive out <char style="add">the inhabitants of</char> Beth-shean and its <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">daughters</char>.</char></note>towns, nor <char style="add">of</char> Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. <verse number="28" style="v"/>And it came to pass, when Israel was waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v"/>And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v"/>Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to taskwork.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v"/>Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; <verse number="32" style="v"/>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="33" style="v"/>Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to taskwork.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="34" style="v"/>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley; <verse number="35" style="v"/>but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to taskwork. <verse number="36" style="v"/>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">Sela</char></char></note>the rock, and upward.</para>
	<chapter number="2" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">a messenger</char></char></note>the angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you: <verse number="2" style="v"/>and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this? <verse number="3" style="v"/>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be <char style="add">as thorns</char> in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And they called the name of that place <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">That is, <char style="it">Weepers</char>.</char></note>Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knew not Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v"/>And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim; <verse number="12" style="v"/>and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And yet they hearkened not unto their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; <char style="add">but</char> they did not so. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. <verse number="19" style="v"/>But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">they let nothing fall of their doings</char>.</char></note>they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; <verse number="21" style="v"/>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died; <verse number="22" style="v"/>that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not. <verse number="23" style="v"/>So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many <char style="add">of Israel</char> as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <verse number="2" style="v"/>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof: <verse number="3" style="v"/><char style="add">namely</char>, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And they were <char style="add">left</char>, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: <verse number="6" style="v"/>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Aram-naharaim</char>.</char></note>Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Aram</char>.</char></note>Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute. <verse number="19" style="v"/>But he himself turned back from the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">graven images</char></char></note>quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body: <verse number="22" style="v"/>and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">he went out into the antechamber</char></char></note>it came out behind. <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened <char style="add">them</char>; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v"/>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">graven images</char></char></note>quarries, and escaped unto Seirah. <verse number="27" style="v"/>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them. <verse number="28" style="v"/>And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">toward Moab</char></char></note>against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over. <verse number="29" style="v"/>And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man. <verse number="30" style="v"/>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v"/>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.</para>
	<chapter number="4" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">nations</char></char></note>Gentiles. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And she <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">sat</char></char></note>dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, <char style="add">saying</char>, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? <verse number="7" style="v"/>And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin&#8217;s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. <verse number="10" style="v"/>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v"/>Now Heber <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">Kain</char>.

	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">nations</char></char></note>Gentiles, unto the river Kishon. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. <verse number="16" style="v"/>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">nations</char></char></note>Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <verse number="18" style="v"/>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <verse number="19" style="v"/>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. <verse number="21" style="v"/>Then Jael Heber&#8217;s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">in a deep sleep and weary; so he died</char></char></note>in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. <verse number="22" style="v"/>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v"/>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. <verse number="24" style="v"/>And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</para>
