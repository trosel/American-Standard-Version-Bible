	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <verse number="2" style="v"/>it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? <verse number="6" style="v"/>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. <verse number="9" style="v"/>And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">over</char></char></note>beside me, and slay me; for <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">giddiness</char></char></note>anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me. <verse number="10" style="v"/>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v"/>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: <verse number="12" style="v"/>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah&#8217;s anointed? <verse number="15" style="v"/>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah&#8217;s anointed.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. <verse number="2" style="v"/>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. <verse number="3" style="v"/>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. <verse number="4" style="v"/>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.</para>
	<para style="p">And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul. <verse number="5" style="v"/>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. <verse number="6" style="v"/>And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul&#8217;s host, had taken <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">In <ref loc="1CH 8:33">1 Chr. 8:33</ref>; <ref loc="1CH 9:39">9:39</ref>, <char style="it">Eshbaal</char>.</char></note>Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; <verse number="9" style="v"/>and he made him king over Gilead, and over the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">The Vulgate and Syriac have, <char style="it">Geshurites</char>.</char></note>Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. <verse number="10" style="v"/>Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">them together</char>.</char></note>them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and <char style="add">thrust</char> his sword in his fellow&#8217;s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">That is, <char style="it">The field of the sharp knives</char>.</char></note>Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. <verse number="17" style="v"/>And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v"/>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">as one of the roes that are in the field</char>.</char></note>as a wild roe. <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <verse number="20" style="v"/>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">spoil</char>. See <ref loc="JDG 14:19">Judg. 14:19</ref>.</char></note>armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <verse number="22" style="v"/>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? <verse number="23" style="v"/>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. <verse number="25" style="v"/>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. <verse number="26" style="v"/>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? <verse number="27" style="v"/>And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">from the morning</char>.</char></note>in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother. <verse number="28" style="v"/>So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. <verse number="29" style="v"/>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v"/>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David&#8217;s servants nineteen men and Asahel. <verse number="31" style="v"/>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner&#8217;s men, <char style="add">so that</char> three hundred and threescore men died. <verse number="32" style="v"/>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v"/>And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; <verse number="3" style="v"/>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <verse number="4" style="v"/>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <verse number="5" style="v"/>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David&#8217;s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">showed himself strong for</char></char></note>made himself strong in the house of Saul. <verse number="7" style="v"/>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and <char style="add">Ish-bosheth</char> said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father&#8217;s concubine? <verse number="8" style="v"/>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog&#8217;s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">the fault of this woman</char></char></note>a fault concerning this woman. <verse number="9" style="v"/>God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him; <verse number="10" style="v"/>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>And Abner sent messengers to David <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">where he was</char></char></note>on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying <char style="add">also</char>, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, when thou comest to see my face. <verse number="14" style="v"/>And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. <verse number="15" style="v"/>And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">In <ref loc="1SA 25:44">1 Sam. 25:44</ref>, <char style="it">Palti</char>.</char></note>Paltiel the son of Laish. <verse number="16" style="v"/>And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you: <verse number="18" style="v"/>now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. <verse number="19" style="v"/>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. <verse number="20" style="v"/>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. <verse number="21" style="v"/>And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Hebrew <char style="it">the troop</char>.</char></note>a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. <verse number="23" style="v"/>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. <verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? <verse number="25" style="v"/>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. <verse number="26" style="v"/>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">cistern</char></char></note>well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v"/>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <verse number="28" style="v"/>And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner: <verse number="29" style="v"/>let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father&#8217;s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread. <verse number="30" style="v"/>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v"/>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier. <verse number="32" style="v"/>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. <verse number="33" style="v"/>And the king lamented for Abner, and said,</para>
	<para style="q1">Should Abner die as a fool dieth?</para>
	<para style="q1"><verse number="34" style="v"/>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:</para>
	<para style="q1">As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.</para>
	<para style="m">And all the people wept again over him. <verse number="35" style="v"/>And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down. <verse number="36" style="v"/>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. <verse number="37" style="v"/>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. <verse number="38" style="v"/>And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? <verse number="39" style="v"/>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>And when <char style="add">Ish-bosheth</char>, Saul&#8217;s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. <verse number="2" style="v"/>And <char style="add">Ish-bosheth</char>, Saul&#8217;s son, <char style="add">had</char> two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin: <verse number="3" style="v"/>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>Now Jonathan, Saul&#8217;s son, had a son that was lame of his feet.

But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</para>
	<chapter number="5" style="c"/>
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. <verse number="2" style="v"/>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be <note caller="-" style="f"><char style="ft">Or, <char style="it">leader</char></char></note>prince over Israel. <verse number="3" style="v"/>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel. <verse number="4" style="v"/>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <verse number="5" style="v"/>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</para>
